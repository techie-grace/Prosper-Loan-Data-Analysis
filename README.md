# Prosper Loan Dataset Exploration
## by Amazing-Grace Umoren


## Dataset

The Prosper Loan Dataset has 113937 rows and 81 column, containing information on the loan and customers. Some features contained in the data includes: Borrowers Rate, Occupation, Number of Credit Line, Credit Score etc. 


## Summary of Findings

Most loan takers came from California and North Dakota had the lowest number of borrowers. Of the 113937, 57478 were home owners and 32192 had an income range between$25,000-49,999. The most documented occupation was "Professional" while homemakers rarely took outloans. Loans were mostly taking out for Debt consolidation and were less likely to be taken out for RV(recreational vehicles). The average loan amount in DC is about 10125 which makes it the state with the highest loan value on average.
There appears to be no direct relationship between the income to debt ratio and prosper scores. Prosper rating AA has the highest prosper score. Most customers have a credit score between 680-699. There is also a negative correlation between Loan amount and borrowers rate.
